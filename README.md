## Installation

It's recommended to install in a `conda` environment; create one using `conda create -n zen_table python=3.9` and activate it using `conda activate zen_table`.

If you just want to use the module, run `pip install .` from the top-level directory.

If you want to install the module to develop it, run `pip install -e .[dev]`
